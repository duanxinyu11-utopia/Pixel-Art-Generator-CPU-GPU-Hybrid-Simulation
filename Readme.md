Target:
This project is a Pixel Art Generator, a small image-processing software that converts normal photos into retro-style pixel art.
  It demonstrates the concept of hybrid computing, where the CPU is responsible for image loading, scaling, and logic control, while the GPU (simulated in software) handles color processing and pixel block computation in parallel.
  The system is designed for users who want to create stylized pixel images for games, art, or social media , and you can compare use different functions (CPU or GPU) getting the result immidertity.
