In the first stage, I will design the system architecture and prepare basic functions such as image loading, pixel block creation, and color quantization using Python and OpenCV.
Then, I will simulate “GPU parallel processing” by using Numba or ThreadPoolExecutor to accelerate pixel color computations.
The interface will be built using Streamlit or Tkinter for easy user interaction.
I will compare the performance of CPU-only and hybrid (CPU + simulated GPU) modes to visualize the efficiency difference.
Finally, I will prepare an evaluation plan that measures performance, usability, and visual quality.
